# MCP experimentation

Repository bringing together all the MCP-related experiments within the Sinequa platform.

## Plugins

The very first integration of MCP capacities within Sinequa WebApps is plugin-based only, i.e. we donâ€™t deliver built-in tools for the moment but only the capacity to add tools by plugin.
In the `plugins` repository can be found implementations of such plugins corresponding to various usecases.
